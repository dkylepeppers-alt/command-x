## How to Use This File

### Before starting work
1. Read this entire file. Pay special attention to [Standing Notes](#standing-notes)
   and the most recent entries in [History](#history).
2. Cross-reference anything relevant to your task. If an entry contradicts the
   problem statement, surface it to the user rather than silently overriding.
3. If this file is empty (no History entries yet), that is expected on the
   first PRs — just proceed and add the first entry when you're done.

### Before opening / finalizing a pull request
1. Add a new entry at the **top** of the [History](#history) section using the
   template below. Newest entries first.
2. Only record information that is **useful to a future agent**. Skip trivia,
   skip restating the PR description, skip things already covered in
   `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
3. If a discovery is broadly applicable (not tied to one PR), also promote it
   into [Standing Notes](#standing-notes) so it is easy to find.
4. Keep entries concise — a few bullets is usually enough. Link to files with
   relative paths and to PRs / commits by number / SHA when helpful.
5. Commit the update to this file as part of the same PR.

### Entry template

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — <short title> (PR #<num> or commit <sha>)

**Context:** one-line summary of what the PR changed or investigated.

**Notes for future agents:**
- Non-obvious fact, decision, or gotcha #1
- Non-obvious fact, decision, or gotcha #2
- …

**Follow-ups / open questions (optional):**
- Anything deferred or worth revisiting
```

## Standing Notes

_Long-lived facts that apply to most work in this repo. Promote entries here
from History when they prove broadly useful. Keep this section tight — if it
grows large, consider moving detail into `CLAUDE.md` or `docs/`._

- This repo has **no build step, no linter config, and no CI**. Validation is
  manual (reload SillyTavern, watch console) plus `node --test test/helpers.test.mjs`.
- All extension logic is in a single file: `index.js`. Do not split it.
- See `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for the deeper
  architecture / conventions reference — those are the primary technical docs.
  This file is for **learned context** that doesn't belong in either of them.

### 2026-04-22 — Nova migration Phase 1 + preset/soul/memory seeds (PR #16)

**Context:** Removed OpenClaw end-to-end; landed `docs/nova-agent-plan.md`;
shipped the `presets/openai/Command-X.json` Chat Completion preset + README;
seeded `nova/soul.md` + `nova/memory.md`; added `nova: {...}` to `DEFAULTS` so
future Nova code has a stable settings shape; added `test/nova-preset.test.mjs`.

**Notes for future agents:**
- **`loadSettings()` has a `LEGACY_KEYS` list** (currently `['openclawMode']`).
  It strips legacy keys from both in-memory `settings` AND
  `ctx.extensionSettings[EXT]`, then calls `saveSettingsDebounced()`. Add to
  the list when retiring any future setting — don't hand-roll a one-off.
- **Do NOT bump `manifest.json` to `0.13.0` yet.** The plan explicitly defers
  the version bump until Nova actually ships, so we don't release a regressed
  intermediate version. Reviewer will flag comments/docs that hard-code
  `v0.13.0` — use version-agnostic wording until Nova lands.
- **Preset schema source of truth**: the upstream ST
  `default/content/presets/openai/Default.json`. The nine marker prompts
  (`chatHistory`, `dialogueExamples`, `worldInfoBefore`, `worldInfoAfter`,
  `charDescription`, `charPersonality`, `scenario`, `personaDescription`,
  `enhanceDefinitions`) **must** all carry `marker: true`. `main`, `nsfw`,
  `jailbreak` are `system_prompt: true` instead. `prompt_order[].order[]`
  entries' identifiers **must** all exist in `prompts[]` — `nova-preset.test.mjs`
  enforces this.
- **Preset Main Prompt teaches the four Command-X tag grammars** (`[sms from=…
  to=…]`, `[status]`, `[quests]`, `[place]`). A dedicated test asserts all
  four grammars appear in the Main Prompt content — if you ever reword the
  prompt, keep every grammar intact or the test fails.
- **`nova/` and `presets/openai/` are new top-level dirs.** They are served
  by ST's static handler (extension folder = `SillyTavern/public/scripts/
  extensions/third-party/command-x/`), so `fetch('./nova/soul.md')` works
  with no plugin — that's the path Nova will use in Phase 6.
- **Running tests**: `node --test test/helpers.test.mjs test/nova-preset.test.mjs`
  works reliably. `node --test 'test/*.test.mjs'` (with the glob quoted) works
  as a one-liner. Bare `node --test test/` does something weird — avoid.
- **`DEFAULTS.nova` shape** is stable and documented in the plan §7b: `{
  profileName, defaultTier, maxToolCalls, turnTimeoutMs, pluginBaseUrl,
  rememberApprovalsSession, activeSkill }`. Phase 2+ code should read from
  `settings.nova.*`; don't spread it flat into `settings`.

**Follow-ups / open questions:**
- Phase 2 (Nova UI tile + view + composer) is the natural next chunk.
- Phase 8 (`nova-agent-bridge` server plugin) is fully independent and can
  land in parallel — nothing in the extension depends on it at init time.
